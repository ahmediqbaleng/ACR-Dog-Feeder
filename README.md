# ACR-Dog-Feeder
As part of the MREN 318 Sensors and Actuators course, the final project consisted of designing an automated pet feeder. Our group designed and constructed the ACR Dog Feeder. The automated feeder utilized an ESP-32 for wireless connectivity and ability to host a web server. This way the user can adjust the feeding schedule and portion size. The entire feeder was designed in SolidWorks and 3D printed. The actuation is done by a NEMA 17 Stepper Motor, turning an auger conveyor to move food into the bowl. A custom power distribution circuit is also utilized to divide the power between the ESP and the motor driver. A load cell provides feedback for the portion control, and the correct amount of food is delivered.
