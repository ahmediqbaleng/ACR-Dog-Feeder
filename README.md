# ACR-Dog-Feeder
As part of the MREN 318 Sensors and Actuators course, the final project consisted of designing an automated pet feeder. Our group designed and constructed the ACR Dog Feeder. The automated feeder utilized an ESP-32 for wireless connectivity and ability to host a web server. This way the user can adjust the feeding schedule and portion size.
